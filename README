N.B.: all commands are relative to o9fs base directory.

1. Compile
# (cd mount && make); make

2. Load
# make load
N.B. securelevel needs to be <= 0.

3. Mount
For a server in the network, do:
# mount/mount_o9fs 'address!port' mtpt

For a server in a unix socket, do:
# mount/mount_o9fs path mtpt

4. Play
