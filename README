N.B.: all commands are relative to o9fs base directory.

1. Compile
# (cd mount && make); make

2. Load
# make load
N.B. securelevel needs to be <= 0.

3. Mount
For a server in the network, do:
# mount/mount_o9fs 'address!port' mtpt

For a server in a unix socket, do:
# mount/mount_o9fs path mtpt

4. Play

TODOs
All numeric variables should have sized types, i.e. uint32_t instead of long
Rename
Change the fid allocation routines. Use pool(9)?
Can we be sure to have a 1:1 mapping between o9fid and vnode?

Need to have at least rev1.24 of /usr/share/mk/bsd.lkm.mk to build.
i386 only. amd64 dies with out of KVA space when loading.
