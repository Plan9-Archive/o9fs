o9fs: A 9P capable virtual filesystem for OpenBSD

Getting the source
------------------
For now, o9fs is only distributed in source form in a mercurial 
repository living at http://src.oitobits.net/o9fs. Then, 

hg clone http://src.oitobits.net/o9fs

will download the source to a o9fs dir.

Compiling
---------
Compiling o9fs consists of building the kernel module and the mount 
program. Kernel sources are required [1].

building module:
cd /path/to/o9fs
make

building mount program:
cd /path/to/o9fs/mount
make

Installing
----------
Installating is done with

sh /path/to/o9fs/install.sh

which will tell you everything you should need.
You should only remember: if you move o9fs to a different place from
where it has been installed, you have to rerun the installation
process.

Running
-------
Loading the kernel module requires a securelevel <= 0.

cd /path/to/o9fs
make load

The mount program is mount_o9fs and should be used like

mount_o9fs 'net!address!port' mountpoint

for mounting a fileserver over the network (tcp), or

mount_o9fs 'unix!path' mountpoint

for mounting a fileserver served by a unix socket.
