- o9fs_{read,write,readdir} should use malloc (or pools) for buffers
- locking
- add options to mount: noauth, auth as other user, port, aname
- v9fs pass the fcall up to the functions instead of bcopying data (as in Tread) like us
- do one walk per lookup, instead of one per name element

known bugs:
cannot unmount without forcing
connect doesn't check if socket is connected to send data
deadlock in VOP_OPEN when trying to acquire the readlock
