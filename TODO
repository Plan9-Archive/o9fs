- o9fs_conv* needs checking for overflows
- o9fs_{read,write,readdir} should use malloc (or pools) for buffers

bugs:
cannot unmount without forcing
connect doesn't check if socket is connected to send data
sometimes system is locked during sync before reboot
deadlock in VOP_OPEN when trying to acquire the readlock
