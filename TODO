- locking
- add options to mount: noauth, auth as other user, port, aname
- v9fs pass the fcall up to the functions instead of bcopying data (as in Tread) like us
- do one walk per lookup, instead of one per name element

known bugs:
cannot unmount without forcing
read/write crashes with len > 1024


- use iovec + uio to describe buffers, as in the rest of the kernel
